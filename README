Welcome to the FLK forth compiler.

FLK is an optimizing native code compiler targeted for the Intel 386+ CPU
running Linux. Porting to other Intel 386 Unixes should not be hard (
recompile it and go.) I'm curious to hear the results in doing so.

FLK is distributed under the GNU public license. See the file COPYING for the
details.

For a successful compilation you need a running FORTH that is able to execute
a script file. gforth and pfe work fine.

To compile and install the system 
- edit Makefile to match your system (path)
- edit f to match your system
- execute: 
   make install
  or
   make xinstall
  (The latter builds xflk which uses the xforms library. If you don't have it,
   just use "make install".)
  
A set of HTML files is provided as a basic help in the directory html.
The entry point is the file index.html.

For guidance and advice: see "Advice and guidance"

For more substantial question contact me. (e-mail below)

Happy forthing.
