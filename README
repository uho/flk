Welcome to the FLK forth compiler.

FLK is an optimizing native code compiler targeted for the Intel 386+ CPU
running Linux. Porting to other Intel 386 Unixes should not be hard (
recompile it and go.) I'm curious to hear the results in doing so.

FLK is distributed under the GNU public license. See the file COPYING for the
details.

For a successful compilation you need a running FORTH that is able to execute
a script file. gforth and pfe work fine.

To compile and install the system 

#this first part has already been done for Linux in the present distribution
make clean
make FORTH32=vfxlin    #default; or
make FORTH32=gforth -e #must be a 32-bit gforth; or
make FORTH32='sf ": name>string count ;"' #or
make FORTH32='flk -e ": name>string count ;" -e' #or another 32-bit Forth
#then
make install

A set of HTML files is provided as a basic help in the directory html.
The entry point is the file index.html.

Happy forthing.

2016 update:

Small changes by Anton Ertl to make it work on current Linux kernels
(where malloc()ed memory is non-executable) and to make it build with
VFX and SwiftForth.
